Menu Generator Project - C Code  

CSC 3200

This code is an automatic menu generator using 3 input files 
to output a final menu once the program is generated.
There is a UI for the user to generate a catered menu specific
to them. 


-----------------------------------------------------
This project Code is implimented in MingGW using the command prompt 

MAKE SURE that the text files:

"BreakFastMenu.txt"
"DinnerMenu.txt"
"LunchMenu.txt"
"output.txt"

are all located in the the same .c file that you are trying to compile
"MenuGenerator.c" in this case.

This will ensure that the program can read the files properly 
-----------------------------------------------------
open command prompt in file location for "MenuGenerator.c"

run command:

"gcc -o MenuGenerator MenuGenerator.c"
"MenuGenerator"

-----------------------------------------------------

once program runs: "output.txt"  will store menu items if accepted!!
