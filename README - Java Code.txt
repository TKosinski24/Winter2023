CSC 3200

This code is an automatic menu generator using 3 input files 
to output a final menu once the program is generated.
There is a UI for the user to generate a catered menu specific
to them. 


-----------------------------------------------------
This project Code is implimented in Java, using Intellij as a compiler 

MAKE SURE that the text files:

"BreakFastMenu.txt"
"DinnerMenu.txt"
"LunchMenu.txt"
"output.txt"

are all located in the java project, but outside the files name:
.idea
out
src

This will ensure that the program can read the files properly

build program in Intellij
then run program!

once program runs: "output.txt"  will store menu items if accepted!!
